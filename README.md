# # REST Assured API Data Driven Testing Framework for PetStore API BY MUSTAPHA-QA

**## About the Project**

**### Overview**

- This project implements a comprehensive data-driven testing framework for a REST API. The framework automates testing of the User model within the Petstore Swagger API, thereby guaranteeing its quality and reliability. It specifically focuses on testing POST, GET, and DELETE HTTP requests utilizing a data-driven approach.

**### Features**

- List of the key features:
  - Test cases covering GET, POST, DELETE HTTP requests: the  framework covers GET, POST, DELETE HTTP methods for interacting with the API endpoints.
  - Data generation using POJOs and Excel file: for the creation of realistic test data, enhancing the robustness and validity of the tests.
  - Extent report and logging: for comprehensive test results and to provide detailed and organized test results for easy monitoring and analysis of test outcomes, aiding in     debugging and identifying potential issues.

**### Technologies Used**

- List the technologies employed:
  - IDE: Eclipse
  - Coding language: Java
  - Test automation framework: TestNG
  - API testing library: REST Assured
  - Build and project management tool: Maven

**## Framework Structure**

- The framework's structure is organized into four packages:

  - ```
    api.endpoints
    ```

    - UserEndpoints class which encapsulates the methods  responsible for performing the different HTTP requests.

  - ```
    api.payload
    ```

    - Houses POJO class representing model data used for testing.

  - ```
    api.test
    ```

    - Contains UserTests class with actual test methods executing HTTP requests.

  - ```
    api.utilities
    ```
    - DataProviders class.
    - ExtentReportManager class for report generation.
    - XLUtility class which helps reading the data from the excel file.

**## Setup and Usage**

- Add necessary dependencies according to the pom.xml file.

**## Project Structure**

To ensure a clear and organized project structure, we've adopted the following conventions:

- Source code:
  - All project packages are located within the `src/test/java`folder, as this is the standard directory for test code in Maven projects.
- External resources:
  - The `src/test/resources` folder serves as a repository for external files essential for testing, including:
    - Schema files for JSON schema validation
    - Configuration files like `log4j2.xml`for logging
    - routes.properties file which encapsulates the URLs.

**## Results Achieved** 

- Comprehensive validation of API responses:
  - **Successful status code verification:** All response status codes matched expectations based on the Swagger document, ensuring successful HTTP requests.
  - **Accurate response body:** Response body data consistently aligned with the API's Swagger document, verifying data integrity.
  - **Header validation:** Selected response headers were verified for correctness.
- Robust error handling:
  - **Meaningful error messages and status codes:** The API returns informative error messages and appropriate status codes in various error scenarios, aiding in troubleshooting and debugging.
- JSON schema validation:
  - **Schema compliance verified:** JSON schemas were successfully validated for different HTTP requests, ensuring adherence to data structure and format requirements.
